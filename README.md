# Dog vs. Cat Classification

## Overview
This project is a machine learning model trained to classify images as either dogs or cats. It utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to achieve high accuracy in image classification tasks.

## Dataset
The model was trained on a dataset consisting of thousands of labeled images of dogs and cats. The dataset was split into training, validation, and test sets to train and evaluate the model's performance.

## Model Architecture
The CNN architecture used for this project consists of multiple convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers to extract features from the images. The extracted features are then passed through fully connected layers to make predictions.

## Performance
The model achieved a good accuracy on the test set, demonstrating its effectiveness in classifying images of dogs and cats.

## Usage
To use this project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in requirements.txt.
3. Run the provided Jupyter notebook to train the model or make predictions on new images.

## Future Improvements
Possible future improvements to this project include:
- Experimenting with different CNN architectures to improve accuracy.
- Augmenting the training data with additional transformations to make the model more robust.
- Fine-tuning hyperparameters to optimize performance further.
